# distance-sensor-cube-timer

A rubiks cube timer using a distance sensor and a raspberry pi 4, and possibly the pi pico to reduce size and cost. It has all the base features i want to add the timer, it still only works on the raspberry pi and a distance sensor which can be coded to work with other things if it outputs True and False to stop and start the timer.

## requirements

to use the distance sensor as the input you need to run the command 'pip install RPi.gpio' in the terminal of the raspberry pi, or you will get an error. 
the code can run on anything that, so if you aren't using a raspberry pi, use an input method that doesn't use the pi's GPIO pins.

## how to use

Download the folder 'distance-sensor-cube-timer' and run the python script 'timer' to start using the timer.

The electronics to make this consist of a raspberry pi 4 (I will be looking into using a pi pico), a bread board, jumper cables and a 
[Distance sensor](https://thepihut.com/products/ultrasonic-distance-sensor-hcsr04?variant=1054704288&currency=GBP&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content).
Then follow the diagram below to connect the sensor to the pi.

All the times and averages will be stored in /distance-sensor-cube-timer/times.txt'.

you can edit the file 'config.py' to chnage the delay, activation distance and average size.

To start and stop the timer hold and object infront of the sensor, it must be within the distance set by 'config.py'in cm for it to register. hold the object
infront of the sensor the amout of time set in 'config.py', when removed the timer will start, to stop the timer put and object back infront of the sensor, then repeat.

you can change the input method by impoorting another module, make sure it outputs True and False, for example, when there is something infront of the sensor it outputs True.
