# distance-sensor-cube-timer

A rubiks cube timer using a distance sensor and a raspberry pi 4, and possibly the pi pico to reduce size and cost.

## How to use

Download the folder 'distance-sensor-cube-timer' and run the python script 'timer'.

The electronics to make this consist of a raspberry pi 4 (I will be looking into using a pi pico), a bread board, jumper cables and a 
[Distance sensor](https://thepihut.com/products/ultrasonic-distance-sensor-hcsr04?variant=1054704288&currency=GBP&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content).
Then follow the diagram below to connect the sensor to the pi.

[How to use the distance sensor](https://tutorials-raspberrypi.com/raspberry-pi-ultrasonic-sensor-hc-sr04/)

All the times and averages will be stored in /distance-sensor-cube-timer/times.txt' along with 'distance_sensor.py', 'config.py' and 'timer.py'

To start and stop the timer hold and object infront of the sensor for 1 second, when removed the timer will start, to stop the timer put and object back infront of the sensor, then repeat.
The distance from the timer to activate it can be changed in the config file.
